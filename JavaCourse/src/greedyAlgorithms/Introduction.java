//Greedy algorithms is the techniqueu to give the best solution from all the available.
/*
 * The greedy method is one of the strategies like divide and conquer used to solve he problems.
 * This method is used for solving optimization problems.
 * An optimization problem is a problem that demands either maximum or minimum results.
 * 
 * The main function of this approach is that the decision is taken on the basis of the currently available information.
 * Whatever the current information is present,the decision is made without worrying about the effect of the current decision in future.
 * This technique is basically used to determine the feasible solution that may or may not be optimal.
 * The feasible solution is a subs thta satisfies the given criteria. The optimal soln is the soln. which is the best and the most favourable solution in the subset.
 * In the case of feasible,if more than one solution satisfies the given criterial than those soultions will be considered as the feasible, whereas the optimal solution is the best solution among all the solutions.
 * 
 * To construct the solution in an optimal way ,this algo creates two sets where one set contains all the chosen items, and another set contains the rejected items.
 * A greedy algorithm makes good local choices in the hope that the solution should be either feasible or optimal.
 * 
 * Components of greedy:
 * 1.Candidate set: A solution that is cretaed from the set is known as a candidate set.
 * 2. selection function:This function is used to choose the candidate or subset which can be added int the soultion.
 * 2. Feasibility function: a function that is used to determine whether the candidate or subset can be used to contribute to the soution or not.
 * 4.Objective:a function is usde to assign the value to the solution or the partial solution.
 * 5.Soution funciton:this fuc is used to intimate whether the complete function has been reached or not.
 * 
 * Applicaation:
 * It is used to find shortest path.
 * find minimum spanning tree using the prim's alogrithm or the krushkal's algorithm.
 * used in a job sequencing with a deadline.
 * also used to sole the fracctional knapsack problem.
